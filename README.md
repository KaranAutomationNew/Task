Flipkart Automation Script
This project contains a Java Selenium WebDriver script designed to automate the process of searching for and purchasing a product on Flipkart. It uses ChromeDriver to control the Chrome browser and perform actions such as searching for a product, selecting it, and initiating the purchase process.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK is installed. You can download it from Oracle's website or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

Maven or Gradle: For dependency management. Alternatively, you can manually download the Selenium library.

Selenium WebDriver: Download the Selenium WebDriver Java client library from the Selenium website.

ChromeDriver: Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from the ChromeDriver site that matches your Chrome browser version.

Setup
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/flipkart-automation.git
cd flipkart-automation
Add Selenium WebDriver Dependency

Download ChromeDriver

Download and place the chromedriver executable in a known location. Update the path/to/chromedriver in the code with the actual path to your chromedriver executable.

The main class of the project is FlipkartAutomation.java. It performs the following actions:

Opens the Flipkart website.
Closes any login popups that may appear.
Searches for a product (e.g., "Laptop").
Selects the first product from the search results.
Clicks on the "Buy Now" button to initiate the purchasing process.
Running the Script
Compile the Code

Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
javac -cp "path/to/selenium-java-4.0.0.jar:path/to/chromedriver" FlipkartAutomation.java



Notes
Login and Payment: This script does not handle user login or payment details. Implementing these features requires additional steps and careful handling of sensitive information.

Dynamic Elements: The CSS selectors used in the script are based on the current structure of the Flipkart website. They may change over time, so you may need to update them accordingly.

Ethics and Compliance: Ensure that the use of this script complies with Flipkart's terms of service. Automated interactions with websites should be conducted responsibly and legally.

Troubleshooting
ChromeDriver Version: Ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your Chrome browser version.
Selectors: If elements are not being found, verify the CSS selectors by inspecting the Flipkart website.
