Flipkart Automation Script
This project contains a Java Selenium WebDriver script designed to automate the process of searching for and purchasing a product on Flipkart. It uses ChromeDriver to control the Chrome browser and perform actions such as searching for a product, selecting it, and initiating the purchase process.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure JDK is installed. You can download it from Oracle's website or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

Maven or Gradle: For dependency management. Alternatively, you can manually download the Selenium library.

Selenium WebDriver: Download the Selenium WebDriver Java client library from the Selenium website.

ChromeDriver: Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from the ChromeDriver site that matches your Chrome browser version.
